# AresNet Judge Q&A Log for Cluely AI Training

This document prioritizes anticipated questions for real-time Q&A coaching. It includes direct answers and cross-references to OFFSET3’s core materials. #faq #pitchdefense #docxref

## Q: Why haven’t you raised $8 million in venture funding yet?

OFFSET3 has been strategically self-funded to date, prioritizing technology development and proof-of-concept validation over early fundraising. We deliberately waited until we could demonstrate a working adversary-adaptive prototype—AresNet—before seeking capital. Our lean-forward strategy is to raise after this pitch, once traction, visibility, and technical validation are in place.

## Q: If this is so good, why hasn’t AFC Cyber CDID, ACM EW/CY, or PEO C3T adopted it yet?

We are early, not late. AresNet was accepted into xTechIgnite because of its novelty. OFFSET3 has engaged with stakeholders at Cyber School, ACM EW, and Project Linchpin to align integration points. We expect accelerated adoption following this prototype demonstration, which is exactly what xTechIgnite is designed to catalyze.

## Q: Your team is very small. How will you deliver something this complex?

OFFSET3 is led by career innovators with access to a distributed bench of trusted cyber, AI, and EW SMEs—many from Army Reserve and warrant officer networks. We scale through partnerships (e.g., ATA, Cyber Ranges) and modular, API-first development strategies.

## Q: How is AresNet different from existing simulation tools like OneSAF or JLCCTC?

AresNet isn’t a simulator—it’s an adversary-adaptive emulator. We fuse Generative AI and real-time stressors like jamming and spoofing. Unlike deterministic replays, AresNet generates mission-aligned C2/ISR/logistics flows and adapts to testbed conditions.

## Q: What’s proprietary about this?

Our IP includes: (1) AI-generated doctrinal mission streams, (2) adversarial effect scaffolding with reinforcement learning, and (3) integration of these into DDIL testbed environments. The fusion of these elements, not just the components, is novel.
