AresNet Adversarial Effects Engine: Updated Proof of Concept (PoC) Development Plan

Version 2.0 | June 2025

## 1. Objectives and Scope

The AresNet Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the core value proposition of AresNet: an AI-driven, adversary-adaptive tactical network simulation environment that models realistic C2 scenarios under Denied, Disrupted, Intermittent, and Limited (DDIL) conditions. This updated PoC integrates Replit demo insights to enhance dynamic adversarial effects logic, multi-zone generation, entity-specific impacts, and temporal dynamics.

## 2. PoC Architecture Overview

The updated PoC integrates the following subsystems:

- Generative AI Core: Generates doctrinally sound, templated C2/ISR/Logistics data flows using static templates or AI prompts (e.g., GPT-4).

- Adversarial Effects Engine: Generates dynamic, adversary-adaptive stressor zones (jamming, spoofing, latency, misinformation) with multi-zone support, entity-anchored effects, and temporal fade-in/out dynamics.

- DDIL Network Emulation Layer: Simulates degraded network conditions (packet loss, latency, bandwidth) with support for multiple zones and varying intensities.

- Scenario Manager: Orchestrates scenario context, adversarial events, and stressor activations in alignment with mission flows.

- Metrics Collector and Visualization: Captures metrics (zone count, radius, intensity, entity impact summaries) and provides real-time visualization overlays (heatmaps, time-series, unit status effects).

Key enhancements:

- Multi-Zone Logic: Generate multiple zones per stressor type, each with unique loci, radii, and intensities based on adversarial levels.

- Entity-Specific Impacts: Anchor zones to red force jammers and blue force C2 nodes; track affected units per zone.

- Temporal Dynamics: Zones fade in/out over time; effects build and decay dynamically.

- Metrics Refinement: Include per-zone metrics (count, size, intensity) and entity-specific impact summaries.

- Doctrinal Validation Pathway: Plan future validation of zone logic against Army data (NTC patterns, unit density, jamming ranges).

## 3. Development Roadmap

Updated phases reflecting Replit insights:

- Phase 0: Set up Dev Environment (Codex, Replit, GitHub)

- Phase 1: Implement Generative AI Core (Minimal)

- Phase 2: Develop Adversarial Effects Engine with Multi-Zone Support and Temporal Dynamics

- Phase 3: Add Probabilistic Models (Spoofing, Latency, Misinformation) with Entity-Linked Logic

- Phase 4: Build Scenario Manager and Metrics Collector with Zone Impact Tracking

- Phase 5: Integrate DDIL Emulation Layer and Multi-Zone Effects

- Phase 6: Refine Visualizations (Heatmaps, Time-Series, Unit Status Overlays)

- Phase 7: Demo Readiness: UX polish, storyboard alignment with pitch deck

## 4. Technical Risk Assessment

- Multi-zone complexity: Mitigated by modular design, parameterization, and iteration.

- Real-world data validation: Pending access to Army data; use doctrinal assumptions as placeholder.

- Map rendering fidelity: Ongoing tuning of spherical trigonometry and zone overlay behavior.

- Time constraints: Focus on core functionality first; iterative enhancement.

## 5. Demo Objectives for Pitch

- Show AI-generated C2/ISR/Logistics traffic flowing into the network.

- Apply multi-zone adversarial effects (jamming, spoofing) dynamically.

- Visualize degraded network conditions (DDIL Zones, Decision Paralysis Zones).

- Demonstrate entity-specific impacts: which units are affected, how, and when.

- Articulate integration plan for Phase I with Army architectures (JNE, Exata, NGC2).

## 6. Next Steps

- Approve updated PoC Plan.

- Select development environment (Codex vs. Replit).

- Kick off Phase 0 setup and coding.

- Refine demo visualizations and metrics alignment with doctrinal standards.

- Draft storyboard integration into xTechIgnite Finals pitch deck.
