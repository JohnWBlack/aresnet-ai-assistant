AresNet – AI-Driven Resilience for NGC2

AI-Driven Resilience for NGC2

Simulating Adversary-Adaptive Network Stress Testing for the U.S. Army

## Introduction

Modern military operations demand command and control (C2) architectures that can adapt and function effectively in contested, degraded, and adversary-adaptive environments. The Army’s Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2) program is a transformative initiative to build such an adaptive, data-centric infrastructure—delivering critical information to decision-makers at the speed of mission execution, even in Denied, Disrupted, Intermittent, and Limited (DDIL) conditions.

Yet, the Army’s current simulation and training tools—including the Joint Network Emulator (JNE) and EXata—fall short of the challenge. While they model connectivity and packet transport, they lack the ability to generate realistic, doctrinally sound operational data streams or simulate adversarial behaviors that evolve in response to mission dynamics. This leaves a critical gap in the Army’s ability to rigorously test and validate the resilience of NGC2 systems against real-world threats.

AresNet is designed to fill this gap. By integrating Generative AI, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic modeling with existing network emulation platforms, AresNet creates a dynamic, mission-aligned digital twin for tactical networks. It produces realistic C2, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), and logistics data streams that follow Army doctrine, while simulating adversarial effects such as jamming, spoofing, misattribution, and cyberattacks.

This white paper introduces AresNet’s concept of operations, outlines its integration with Army architectures—including JNE, EXata, NGC2, and Project Linchpin—and details its benefits to the Army’s readiness, decision dominance, and future operational resilience. It also provides a forward-looking roadmap for developing AresNet’s AI/ML core—an active area of research focused on creating an adaptive, adversary-aware training and testing environment for the Army’s future C2 systems.

Together, these elements form the foundation for a new capability—one that empowers the Army to train, test, and adapt its C2 systems for the complex, contested operational environments of the 21st century.





## Concept of Operations

AresNet is a modular, software-defined system designed to enhance the Army’s NGC2 digital backbone by creating a realistic, adversary-adaptive simulation environment for command and control (C2) networks. Its architecture integrates advanced AI/ML capabilities, network simulation platforms, and Army data fabrics to provide a comprehensive, real-time stress testing solution for multi-domain operations.

AresNet is composed of four primary subsystems that work together to generate realistic, doctrinally sound data streams, simulate adversarial behaviors, model dynamic network conditions, and ensure seamless integration within the Army’s digital ecosystem.

## Core Subsystems

AresNet is built around three core subsystems, each providing a distinct capability essential for creating a realistic, adversary-adaptive simulation environment.

Generative AI Core – Synthesizes doctrinally sound C2, ISR, and logistics data streams to mirror real-world operations.

Adversarial Effects Engine – Simulates dynamic, evolving adversary behaviors using reinforcement learning and probabilistic models.

DDIL Network Emulation Layer – Models realistic network degradations, including jamming, spoofing, and limited connectivity, in alignment with tactical scenarios.

Together, these subsystems create a dynamic, mission-relevant simulation environment that enables the Army to rigorously test and validate NGC2 systems under realistic adversarial conditions.

## Generative AI Core

AresNet’s Generative AI Core is responsible for creating doctrinally sound, mission-aligned data streams that mirror the types of communications and reports generated in real-world operations. These include:

C2 messages (e.g., fragmentary orders, situation reports, operational summaries)

ISR feeds (e.g., UAV sensor data, SIGINT intercepts, ELINT tracks)

Logistics updates (e.g., supply requests, maintenance reports, movement orders)

This AI core leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to produce realistic operational narratives and associated data flows. The AI models are trained on doctrinal content, operational patterns, and historical scenarios—augmented with datasets from Army programs such as Project Linchpin and NGC2 telemetry—ensuring alignment with Army tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

## Adversarial Effects Engine

The Adversarial Effects Engine introduces dynamic, evolving threat simulations into AresNet, modeling a range of adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that can degrade or disrupt network performance under realistic operational conditions.

Jamming and spectrum denial

Spoofing and false data injection

Latency injection and bandwidth degradation

Cyberattacks, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and malware propagation

Misattribution and deception techniques

By modeling adversaries as adaptive agents rather than static threats, AresNet introduces realistic, evolving challenges that stress C2 system performance in ways that static simulation tools cannot.

## DDIL Network Emulation Layer

AresNet integrates with existing Army network emulation platforms, such as the Joint Network Emulator (JNE), EXata, and EMANE, to provide transport-layer fidelity. It leverages open standards—including DIS, HLA, and STANAG protocols—for seamless data exchange, ensuring that synthetic data streams and adversarial effects flow natively into the Army’s simulation environments.

This integration enables AresNet to impose realistic DDIL conditions—denied, disrupted, intermittent, and limited communications—on tactical networks, creating a testbed for evaluating the resilience of NGC2 systems.

## NGC2 Data Fabric and Army Integration

AresNet is designed for compatibility with the Army’s evolving digital infrastructure, including the NGC2 data fabric, Project Linchpin’s AI/ML operations framework, and cloud/edge computing environments. By aligning with these architectures, AresNet ensures that AI-generated scenarios and stress-testing effects can be delivered directly into Army training networks, supporting both operational testing and large-scale exercises.

## Operational Flexibility

AresNet is designed with modularity in mind, offering two primary deployment options to meet varying Army resource constraints, security postures, and training objectives

Natively within Army systems, fully embedded in JNE/EXata/Linchpin frameworks.

In a hybrid mode, where AI processing occurs externally (e.g., in secure data centers or clouds) and outputs are fed back into the Army networks.
This flexibility ensures AresNet can adapt to different resource constraints, security postures, and training objectives.

This flexibility ensures AresNet can scale and adapt across a wide range of operational environments and technical architectures.

## Next Steps

The detailed design of AresNet’s AI/ML core—including the generative model architectures, reinforcement learning agents, and data pipelines—is a key focus of our ongoing research. While this technical layer is still under development, our integration strategy with Army networks is clear: deliver an AI-powered, adversary-adaptive simulation environment that enhances NGC2 resilience and operational readiness.

## Integration with Army Architectures

AresNet is purpose-built for seamless integration with the Army’s evolving digital ecosystem. Its design aligns with current and emerging Army architectures, enabling plug-and-play functionality within existing simulation environments, data fabrics, and AI/ML operational frameworks. This section outlines how AresNet integrates with key Army systems, ensuring interoperability, scalability, and mission relevance.

## Joint Network Emulator (JNE) and EXata Integration

AresNet is engineered to run natively within Army network emulation platforms, including JNE and EXata. By leveraging these widely adopted tools, AresNet minimizes the need for additional infrastructure and ensures that AI-generated traffic and adversarial effects flow directly into existing training and testing environments.

AresNet’s integration with the Joint Network Emulator (JNE) and EXata is built on a foundation of standards-based interoperability, allowing it to seamlessly inject AI-generated traffic, adversarial effects, and realistic scenarios into existing Army network emulation environments.

Standards-Based APIs: AresNet supports open standards such as Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), High-Level Architecture (HLA), and STANAG protocols, ensuring compatibility with JNE, EXata, and other simulation frameworks.

Scenario Injection: Doctrinally sound data streams generated by AresNet can be injected directly into JNE/EXata simulations, enabling dynamic testing of C2 systems under realistic conditions.

Network Stress Testing: The Adversarial Effects Engine operates within JNE/EXata environments, applying adaptive stressors such as jamming, latency, and spoofing, synchronized with mission context.

This native integration allows AresNet to serve as an AI-driven augmentation layer for existing Army network emulation tools, transforming static models into dynamic, adversary-adaptive environments.

## NGC2 Data Fabric Alignment

AresNet is designed to align with the Army’s Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2) data-centric architecture. By generating mission-relevant, AI-driven data streams, AresNet feeds the NGC2 fabric with synthetic yet realistic operational traffic—including C2 orders, ISR feeds, logistics reports, and adversarial signals—ensuring that the data flows tested in simulation mirror those encountered in real-world operations.

This alignment supports NGC2’s core objective: enabling decision superiority through reliable, timely access to critical information, even in contested and degraded conditions.

## Project Linchpin and AI/ML Operational Frameworks

AresNet is designed to complement and extend the Army’s AI/ML ecosystem, including Project Linchpin, by providing a robust testbed for stress-testing AI models and validating their performance in complex, adversarial scenarios.

AresNet’s generative models and adversarial agents can serve as synthetic data sources for Linchpin’s AI/ML pipelines.

By simulating adversary behaviors and network degradations, AresNet enables validation of AI models against complex, contested scenarios, reducing bias and blind spots in machine learning systems.

The system’s modular design allows it to operate within Linchpin’s GPU-accelerated AI infrastructure or connect via secure APIs from external processing environments.

By integrating seamlessly with Project Linchpin and related AI/ML frameworks, AresNet ensures its outputs are aligned with the Army’s evolving data-centric architecture and AI-driven operational goals.

## Deployment Flexibility: Native vs. Hybrid Models

While AresNet is optimized for native deployment within Army networks, it is also designed to accommodate hybrid processing models. In cases where GPU resources or AI acceleration are limited within the Army’s infrastructure, AresNet can ingest NGC2 data and telemetry, process it externally in a secure enclave or cloud, and deliver the resulting synthetic data and adversarial effects back into the Army’s systems. This flexibility ensures AresNet remains viable across a range of operational constraints, training objectives, and security postures.

## Security and Compliance Considerations

AresNet’s integration strategy adheres to DoD cybersecurity standards, including:

RMF Compliance: Risk Management Framework alignment for secure deployment.

Data Encryption: End-to-end encryption of sensitive simulations and outputs.

Controlled Access: Role-based access controls to ensure authorized use within Army networks.

## Summary

By embedding directly into the Army’s JNE/EXata simulation environments, aligning with the NGC2 data fabric, and supporting Project Linchpin’s AI/ML frameworks, AresNet offers a fully interoperable, modular solution for stress-testing C2 networks in adversarial, DDIL conditions. Its flexible deployment model ensures compatibility with Army infrastructure today—while scaling for the challenges of tomorrow.

## Benefits to the Army

AresNet delivers a transformative capability for the Army’s NGC2 initiative by enabling realistic, adversary-adaptive stress testing of tactical networks in simulated DDIL environments. By fusing Generative AI, adversarial modeling, and network emulation, AresNet equips commanders, system developers, and network engineers with a dynamic testing and training tool that goes beyond static bandwidth modeling or scripted scenarios.

The six key benefits to the Army can be summarized as follows: enhancing decision superiority in contested environments; increasing the realism and relevance of training; accelerating the development and validation of NGC2 capabilities; supporting modular, reversible, and tunable training scenarios; enabling dual-use innovation for broader impact; and building a foundation for future AI-enabled warfare.

## 1. Enhancing Decision Superiority in Contested Environments

AresNet enables commanders to evaluate how NGC2 systems will perform under adversarial conditions—before they face them in combat. By simulating evolving threats such as jamming, spoofing, and cyberattacks in a realistic operational context, AresNet provides a vital risk reduction capability, ensuring that NGC2 architectures can deliver decision-quality data in the fog and friction of war.

## 2. Increasing the Realism and Relevance of Training

Current network training often focuses on technical metrics like latency or packet loss, but lacks doctrinally aligned operational context. AresNet fills this gap by generating realistic C2, ISR, and logistics data streams—orders, reports, and signals—that mirror the operational tempo and complexity of real-world missions. This full-context simulation allows training audiences to practice decision-making under authentic conditions, improving preparedness for multi-domain operations (MDO).

## 3. Accelerating the Development and Validation of NGC2 Capabilities

AresNet serves as an agile testbed for Army developers and program offices. By introducing adversarial stressors and realistic operational data into simulated environments, AresNet enables rapid iteration, debugging, and validation of new software releases, network configurations, and AI/ML models. This capability supports a DevSecOps approach, shortening the feedback loop between development and operational validation.

## 4. Supporting Modular, Reversible, and Tunable Training Scenarios

AresNet’s design allows trainers to precisely tune the intensity and type of adversarial effects—ranging from mild degradations to catastrophic failures—based on specific learning objectives. Scenarios can be paused, reset, or replayed, providing flexibility for large-scale exercises, small-unit rehearsals, or technology validation events. This adaptability enhances the utility of AresNet across diverse training and testing use cases.

## 5. Enabling Dual-Use Innovation for Broader Impact

While AresNet is designed for Army applications, its architecture has strong dual-use potential. Commercial sectors such as telecommunications, cybersecurity, and autonomous systems face similar challenges in ensuring network resilience against evolving threats. AresNet’s AI-driven digital twin approach can serve as a platform for these industries to model and mitigate risks in high-stakes environments, creating opportunities for technology transfer, commercialization, and cross-sector collaboration.

## 6. Building a Foundation for Future AI-Enabled Warfare

AresNet is more than a simulation tool—it is a foundational capability for the Army’s vision of AI-enabled command and control. By integrating Generative AI and reinforcement learning into the tactical network fabric, AresNet sets the stage for future systems that can autonomously adapt to adversary actions, anticipate disruptions, and maintain information superiority in the most challenging operational environments.

## Technical Roadmap (In Development)

While AresNet’s integration strategy and high-level architecture are well-defined, the detailed design of its AI/ML core remains an active area of research and development. This section outlines the key technical components under development, their intended functions, and the roadmap for maturing AresNet into a fully operational capability.

## Generative AI Core for Doctrinal Data Generation

At the heart of AresNet is the Generative AI Core, responsible for producing realistic, mission-relevant data streams aligned with Army doctrine and operational patterns.  The Generative AI Core is designed to produce four categories of doctrinally sound data streams: C2 communications such as fragmentary orders and situation reports; ISR feeds including UAV imagery and SIGINT intercepts; logistics data such as supply requests and movement orders; and operational narratives that connect discrete data points into coherent mission contexts.

C2 Communications: Fragmentary orders, situation reports, command updates, and tasking messages.

ISR Feeds: Simulated UAV imagery, SIGINT intercepts, ELINT tracks, and sensor reports.

Logistics Data: Supply requests, movement orders, maintenance status updates, and sustainment reports.

Operational Narratives: Contextual narratives that link discrete data points into a coherent operational picture.

The initial design approach integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned on doctrinal text and operational data; Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for structured data generation aligned with scenario parameters; and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that adapt data generation in response to mission dynamics and adversarial conditions.

Large Language Models (LLMs): Fine-tuned on doctrinal text, tactical reports, and historical mission data.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): For structured data generation aligned with scenario parameters.

Reinforcement Learning (RL): To adapt data generation in response to evolving mission dynamics and adversarial effects.

Ongoing work includes defining input schemas (e.g., scenario templates, mission objectives), output formats (e.g., JSON/CSV structured data, simulated voice/text messages), and validation pipelines to ensure doctrinal alignment and operational plausibility.

## Adversarial Effects Engine for Threat Simulation

The Adversarial Effects Engine brings a dynamic, evolving layer of threat simulation into the AresNet environment by modeling adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) through AI agents and probabilistic systems.

Reinforcement Learning Agents: Trained to model adversary TTPs such as jamming, spoofing, false data injection, and cyberattacks.

Probabilistic Modeling: To simulate evolving threat landscapes, inject variability into scenario outcomes, and model uncertainties (e.g., signal degradation over time, success probabilities of deception techniques).

This engine will enable scenario designers and trainers to configure adversary profiles, specify intensity levels, and observe how NGC2 systems adapt under contested conditions.

## Data Sources and Training Sets

AresNet’s data sources will combine structured Army-provided materials, synthetic datasets generated through AI models to fill gaps in scenario coverage, and select open-source intelligence to inform adversary modeling where appropriate.

Army-Provided Datasets: Including doctrinal documents, Project Linchpin datasets, and NGC2 telemetry data (where available).

Synthetic Data Generation: Augmenting limited datasets with AI-generated exemplars for underrepresented mission types or threat scenarios.

Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT): Where appropriate, to model adversary capabilities and behaviors.

A critical next step is establishing a data curation pipeline that enforces doctrinal correctness, scenario plausibility, and operational security in AI model training and evaluation.

## Validation and Testing Plan

The validation and testing plan for AresNet follows a phased approach, progressing from initial concept development to operational testing and future system evolution.

Phase I (Concept Development): Refining AI model architectures, defining input/output schemas, and building proof-of-concept prototypes for core components.

Phase II (Operational Testing): Integrating AresNet with JNE/EXata environments, testing AI-generated data streams and adversarial effects in Army-relevant scenarios, and validating system performance against NGC2 operational requirements.

Future Phases: Expanding the system’s adversarial repertoire, improving model scalability, and exploring deployment on Army cloud/edge infrastructure.

## Open Questions and Research Priorities

The AresNet development team is actively exploring several open technical questions to ensure the system’s utility, scalability, and alignment with Army operational needs.

How to ensure generated data streams remain doctrinally valid and operationally useful across diverse mission contexts.

How to represent adversary adaptation and decision-making in a way that is both realistic and tunable for training purposes.

How to balance model complexity and computational demands to maintain performance in resource-constrained Army environments.

How to implement robust security, compliance, and model interpretability features to ensure trustworthiness and alignment with DoD standards.

## Path Forward

AresNet’s technical roadmap is ambitious but achievable. We are committed to working collaboratively with Army stakeholders—acquisition professionals, operators, and technical experts—to refine requirements, prioritize use cases, and ensure that AresNet evolves into a mission-relevant, operationally deployable capability.

## Conclusion

The Army’s ability to achieve decision dominance in multi-domain operations hinges on the resilience of its command and control (C2) networks under contested, degraded, and adversary-adaptive conditions. The Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2) initiative is a bold step toward building this adaptive digital backbone. However, existing simulation and training tools fall short of enabling commanders, developers, and trainers to fully test and validate C2 systems against the evolving, AI-enabled threats of modern warfare.

AresNet fills this critical gap. By combining Generative AI, reinforcement learning, and network emulation, AresNet creates a dynamic, adversary-adaptive simulation environment that goes beyond static network testing. It enables the Army to generate doctrinally sound C2, ISR, and logistics data streams, inject realistic adversarial effects such as jamming and spoofing, and evaluate system resilience in the fog and friction of simulated conflict.

This white paper has outlined AresNet’s core concepts, its integration pathways with Army architectures such as JNE, EXata, NGC2, and Project Linchpin, and the roadmap for evolving its AI/ML core. While the technical details of the AI models are still in development, the vision is clear: AresNet offers a transformative capability for the Army to rigorously test, train, and prepare its C2 systems for the realities of 21st-century conflict.

Moving forward, we invite collaboration with Army stakeholders—warfighters, developers, and acquisition professionals alike—to refine requirements, shape use cases, and ensure AresNet evolves into a fully deployable capability. Together, we can build the adaptive, AI-driven resilience that the Army’s future demands.
