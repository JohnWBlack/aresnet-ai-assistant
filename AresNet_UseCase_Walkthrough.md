# AresNet Scenario Walkthrough

## Scenario: Brigade Movement in a DDIL Environment

- **Blue Force Objective**: Move mechanized units to secure a forward operating base.
- **Adversarial Stressors**: RL-generated jamming, spoofed ISR feeds, bandwidth throttling.
- **Simulation Result**: C2 resilience tested under degraded conditions, resulting in tactical delay and adaptation of mission orders.

## Outcome

AresNet reveals how decision latency and packet loss disrupt C2 effectivenessâ€”and enables iterative resilience tuning.
