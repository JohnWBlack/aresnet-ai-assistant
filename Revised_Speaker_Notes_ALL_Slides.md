## Slide 2 - The Problem: Why the Army needs AresNet

“I fought my first war in Desert Storm—our last full-scale, high-intensity war. Back then, we relied on radios, line-of-sight, and our own eyes. We didn’t worry about cyber attacks or packet loss. But that world is gone.  

Since then, I’ve watched our dependence on digital networks grow—during deployments to Iraq, Africa, Korea. Our C2 has become faster, smarter… but more fragile.  

Today’s adversaries don’t just target our forces—they target our networks, jamming our signals, spoofing our feeds, and paralyzing our decisions.  

This slide doesn’t just show a technical failure. It shows what it feels like when the fog of war turns digital. That’s the battlefield we must train for now.”


## Slide 3 - AresNet: AI-Driven Adversarial Emulation for Resilient Decision-Making

“AresNet is how we prepare. It’s not just simulation—it’s adversarial emulation powered by AI.  
It generates doctrinal C2, ISR, and logistics traffic—while injecting live, adaptive adversarial effects: jamming, spoofing, misinfo.  

Imagine your C2 system not just working under ideal conditions—but surviving against a thinking, learning opponent.  

And we built it for the Army from day one—integrating with JNE, Exata, Project Linchpin—because future readiness must be realistic.”


## Slide 4 - AresNet Army Benefits

“The Army gains a stress-testing environment it can trust—because it mirrors the adversary’s mindset.  
It hardens our systems, trains our warfighters, and validates resilience before we deploy.  

In short: AresNet helps us keep decision dominance—not just in theory, but under fire.”


## Slide 5 - AresNet Technical Approach: AI-Driven, Adversarially Adaptive Emulation

“This is AresNet: an AI-Driven, Adversarially Adaptive Emulation platform. It’s designed to create realistic, dynamic, and non-deterministic C2 environments for Army resilience testing. At the core of AresNet is a multi-layer digital twin architecture that fuses three key components: the Generative AI Core, the Adversarial Effects Engine, and the DDIL Network Emulation Layer. Each of these components plays a unique role in replicating the complexity of modern multi-domain operations.”


## Slide 6 - AresNet Technical Approach: Generative AI Core

“The Generative AI Core is where AresNet builds the foundation of realism. It produces doctrinally sound C2, ISR, and logistics data streams—aligned with Army doctrine and validated against real-world operational logs. This isn’t just static replay data. It’s dynamic, mission-relevant content—FRAGOs, ISR feeds, logistics requests—generated in real-time to adapt to the evolving mission context and adversarial pressures. This ensures every scenario in AresNet feels operationally valid and aligned to Army TTPs.”


## Slide 7 - AresNet Technical Approach: Adversarial Effects Engine

“The Adversarial Effects Engine is where we inject the chaos of the contested information sphere. This component uses reinforcement learning and probabilistic algorithms to model evolving adversary tactics—jamming, spoofing, latency injection, misinformation, and deception. AresNet doesn’t just replay pre-scripted attacks. It simulates adaptive, non-deterministic behavior—constantly adjusting and reacting. This enables operators to train against the kind of dynamic threats they’ll face in real-world contested, degraded, and denied conditions.”


## Slide 8 - AresNet Technical Approach: DDIL Network Emulation Layer

“The final piece is the DDIL Network Emulation Layer—where AresNet models the transport-level reality of Army networks under stress. This layer simulates packet loss, latency, jitter, and bandwidth throttling—using JNE, Exata, and operational logs to achieve realistic fidelity. It’s how AresNet delivers Denied, Degraded, Intermittent, and Limited environments for testing. This empowers Army operators to validate the resilience of C2 systems before deployment—and develop the skills to adapt in the face of degraded network states.”

## Slide 9 - Built for Army Integration: NGC2, JNE, Exata, Linchpin

“We designed AresNet to plug into what the Army already uses—JNE, Exata, Linchpin. 
We’re not asking for new infrastructure. We’re reinforcing what’s already working—with the adversary in the loop.”


## Slide 10 - Technical Risks & Mitigation Strategy

“This is hard tech. But our team has been here before. From Zero Trust to red teaming, doctrine to design—we’ve lived this mission.
And OFFSET3? We’ve been working on this challenge since I founded the company in 2016… under the banner of something most people forgot…”


## Slide 11 - AresNet Crawl-Walk-Run Roadmap

“The name OFFSET3 comes from the Third Offset Strategy—an idea that emerging tech could restore American dominance.

My first war was fought under the shadow of Offset 1—our nuclear deterrent. Then came digitization: Offset 2.

But today, AI is the new frontier—and OFFSET3 was born to meet that shift. We’ve been building AresNet for this moment—when digital resilience means battlefield survival.”


## Slide 12 - Partner Profiles and Platform Integration

“And we’re not doing it alone. Cyber Ranges, ATA—trusted DoD partners who bring real-world training, red teaming, and workforce development into this ecosystem.”


## Slide 13 - AresNet Commercialization Strategy

“What we build for the Army, we scale to telecom, cloud, autonomous systems—because resilience is mission-critical across domains.”


## Slide 14 - Let’s Build the Future of C2 Together

“Let’s take a moment to step back and remember what’s at stake here. The future of command and control—the Army’s ability to make decisions, act faster than adversaries, and win the fight—depends on resilient, adaptive networks that can stand up to evolving threats.

That’s why we’ve built AresNet—an adversary-adaptive AI solution aligned with the Army’s mission for Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2).

We’re not just building another simulation tool. We’re creating an AI-driven digital twin for the battlefield—one that generates realistic mission data, simulates dynamic adversary tactics, and allows you to test and train under the most challenging, degraded conditions imaginable.

With AresNet, the Army can:
Support NGC2, Linchpin, and C2 readiness—by integrating seamlessly with Army architectures.
Leverage a proven team—OFFSET3, Cyber Ranges, and ATA—who’ve delivered advanced capabilities across the DoD and commercial sectors.
Fuse AI with adversary TTPs—a true first-of-its-kind innovation that no one else is doing.
And embrace a dual-use strategy that benefits not just the Army, but also sectors like telecom, 5G, and critical infrastructure.

So, our call to action is simple:
- Let’s build AresNet together.
- Let’s build resilience into the Army’s C2 backbone.
- And most importantly, let’s build the future of decision dominance together.”
