## Quick Summary

AresNet is a GenAI-enabled adversarial simulation platform designed to stress-test military C2 systems under contested battlefield conditions. It models doctrinally aligned data streams (C2, ISR, logistics) and applies adversary-adaptive jamming, deception, spoofing, latency, and misinformation. Built to align with U.S. Army priorities like Project Linchpin and the NGC2 data fabric, AresNet enables rigorous, scenario-driven testing in DDIL environments.

## Market Opportunity

The rise of contested communications, spectrum denial, and AI-enabled adversaries makes C2 readiness a top priority for defense organizations. AresNet targets DoD acquisition programs (NGC2, Project Linchpin), training systems, and commercial dual-use markets like telecom and critical infrastructure.

## Ask

We estimate $8M is required to fully develop and scale the MVP. Weâ€™re seeking pre-seed or seed-stage investment to bridge the SBIR funding gap, advance integration, and accelerate go-to-market traction.
